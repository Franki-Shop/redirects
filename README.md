# redirect-page-js

Redirect from a bootstrap webpage to another website using JavaScript with a countdown timer

You only need to customize these two lines of code.

var seconds = 10;
var redirectDomain = "theafricanboss.com";

Below is a screenshot of how it looks like without the stroke.

*The black stroke around the page was used to show the page is vertically and horizontally centered in the page using Bootstrap.
